**Goal**

A suite of tools to help solve the most important marine problems in India using technology. We are building scalable open source technology products to solve marine conservation-based problems in India. We are building tools that are:

- Exclusively for marine-related cases/problems
- Solve common pain points for a number of organisations
- Augment the capabilities of organisations to achieve their marine conservation goals
- Primarily open source. Hosted on Github. Available for everyone to use freely.

**Need**
> Alone we can do so little; Together we can do so much - Hellen Keller

There are already motivated founders and people in NGOs building organisations to work towards conservation. These organisations are made up of passionate people who have strong domain and marine knowledge.

However, they usually don’t have the capability to develop technology or use technology effectively to solve their problems. Too many NGOs are doing really good work in India but don’t have the best tech expertise and thus lose out on a lot of opportunities to accelerate or solve their use cases. 

This is where we come in. We help them build their technology while they work on their main cause. We figure out how a particular technology solution can help them and then build it to solve that particular pain point.
